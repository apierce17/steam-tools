# Steam-Tools
This was a personal project for me to dive into API's and JQuery. In this web app you can pull a random steam app or compare your Steam game library and a friends steam library.

Note: As of right now the deployed page does not connect to the API because of CORS issues, I will be resolving this issue in a future release but I have added instructions below on how to run on your own machine.

If you would like to see the front end work you can still view the deployed site [here](https://apierce17.github.io/steam-tools/) or watch the demo below:
