# Steam-Tools
This was a personal project for me to dive into API's and JQuery. In this web app you can pull a random steam app or compare your Steam game library and a friends steam library.

Note: As of right now the deployed page does not connect to the API because of CORS issues, I will be resolving this issue in a future release but I have added instructions below on how to run on your own machine.

If you would like to see the front end work you can still view the deployed site [here](https://apierce17.github.io/steam-tools/).

## Languages & Tools
HTML

CSS

JavaScript/JQuery

Steam Web API

## Install & Usage
1. Download the project from this github repository

2. Get your own Steam Web API key from the steam site

3. In the ```Compare.js``` and ```random-game.js``` file replace ``` 'STEAM_API_KEY_HERE' ``` with your key

4. Run locally and use a browser plugin to disable cors
